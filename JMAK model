Project: JMAK (Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov) Model Material Analysis
=======================================================================

Purpose
-------
This project implements the **JMAK model** to analyze phase transformation kinetics in materials.  
The Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model is widely used to describe **nucleation and growth processes** during phase transformations, such as crystallization, precipitation, or solid-state reactions.  

Using the model, this analysis allows:
- Estimation of transformation fraction over time.
- Prediction of material behavior under thermal treatments.
- Correlation of stress, deformation, and temperature during transformations.
- Comparison of different experimental or simulation runs (r1, r2, r3, etc.).

JMAK Model Overview
-------------------
The **Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model** is a mathematical framework used to describe **the kinetics of phase transformations** in solids.  
It provides a relation between **the fraction of transformed material** and **time** under isothermal or non-isothermal conditions.

**Key Equation:**
X(t) = 1 − exp(−k * t^n)  

Where:  
- `X(t)` = fraction of material transformed at time `t` (0 ≤ X ≤ 1)  
- `k` = rate constant (depends on temperature and material properties)  
- `n` = Avrami exponent (depends on nucleation type, growth dimensionality, and impingement)  

**Interpretation of Parameters:**
1. **Avrami exponent (n):**
   - Describes the mechanism of nucleation and growth.
   - Typical values:
     - n ≈ 1 → One-dimensional growth (needle-like)
     - n ≈ 2 → Two-dimensional growth (plate-like)
     - n ≈ 3 → Three-dimensional growth (spherical)
   - Also affected by whether nucleation is continuous or instantaneous.  

2. **Rate constant (k):**
   - Represents the overall transformation rate.
   - Strongly temperature-dependent, often expressed using the Arrhenius relation:
     k = k₀ * exp(−Q/(R*T))  
     where Q is activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is absolute temperature.  

3. **Fraction transformed (X(t)):**
   - Starts at 0 (no transformation) and approaches 1 as the transformation completes.  

**Assumptions of JMAK Model:**
- Homogeneous nucleation (nucleation occurs randomly throughout the material).  
- Isotropic growth (growth rate same in all directions).  
- Constant nucleation and growth rates during isothermal conditions.  
- Overlapping of growing transformed regions is accounted for statistically.  

Input File Format
-----------------
The analysis requires time-based datasets, generally in **two-column format**. Each input file corresponds to one of the following types:

1. **Time vs Temperature**
   - Column 1: Time (s)
   - Column 2: Temperature (°C)

2. **Time vs Deformation**
   - Column 1: Time (s)
   - Column 2: Deformation (dimensionless strain or mm/mm)

3. **Time vs Stress**
   - Column 1: Time (s)
   - Column 2: Stress (MPa)

**Formatting Guidelines:**
- Time column must be consistent across all datasets.
- Use period `.` for decimals.
- Columns can be separated by tabs, spaces, or commas.
- Optional header row recommended, e.g.:
  `Time(s), Temperature(C)`  
  `Time(s), Deformation`  
  `Time(s), Stress(MPa)`

Analysis Procedure
------------------
1. **Load Input Data:** Import all datasets into the analysis environment (Python, MATLAB, or Excel).  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensure time columns align; interpolate if necessary.
   - Convert units if needed (e.g., MPa → Pa).  
3. **JMAK Model Implementation:**
   - Transformation fraction `X(t)` is modeled using:  
     X(t) = 1 − exp(−k * t^n)  
   - Fit model parameters `k` and `n` to experimental or simulation data using regression techniques.  
4. **Derived Calculations:**
   - Residual stress `σ_res`
   - Deformation rate  
5. **Visualization:**
   - Plot **Time vs Temperature**, **Time vs Stress**, **Time vs Deformation**, **Time vs X(t)**, **Time vs σ_res**
   - Compare multiple runs (r1, r2, r3) for trends.  
6. **Interpretation:**
   - Observe phase transformation kinetics.
   - Identify critical transformation points and stress peaks.
   - Assess material stability after transformations.  

Observations and Recommendations
---------------------------------
- Transformation fraction `X(t)` typically starts at 0 and approaches 1 asymptotically.  
- Stress increases during initial cooling and decreases as the material relaxes.  
- Deformation accumulates gradually, often stabilizing at later times.  
- Residual stress is critical for predicting long-term material behavior.  
- Always validate the input data and the time alignment across datasets.
